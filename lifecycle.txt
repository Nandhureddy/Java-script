There are many different life cycle methods, 
we can break React’s Life Cycle Methods down into two categories.

-> When a component get mounted to the DOM and unmounted.
->When a component receives new data.
Mounting:
life cycle methods which are called when the component is initialized and added to the DOM.

componentDidMount() {

  }

  Unmounting:
 when the component is removed from the DOM called unmounting.Then, these methods will be invoked only once during the life of the component.

componentWillUnmount() {

  }
