JSX:
It is an extension to javascript.It was written to be used with react.
JSX code similar to HTML.

JSX element:
JSX elements looks exactly as HTML,The only differece is that we will write the code in java script file instead of HTML file.
JSX element can be saved in a variable,stored in an object ,stored in an array, or pass to a function.

Example:
<p>welcome</p>

JSX variable Example:
const a=<p>welcome</p>;

we can store multiple jsx elements in single variable.A JSX must have only one outer most element.
Nested:
const a=(<div>
	<p>welcome</p>
	<h1>Hello world</h1>
	</div>);

Rendering JSX:
React DOM is the name of a java script library,Its has several react methods which deals with DOM.

reactDOM.render().(It is a way to render JSX)

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Render me</h1>,document.getElementById('container')); Here we passed 2 arguments.First argument is JSX which will display on the screen.
and it is appended to whatever element is selected by the second argument.

<div id="container">
	<h1>render me</h1>
        </div>

Updating rendered elements:
 We can not change the react elements, once we created.
If we want to update first we need to create new element then pass it to reactDOM.render();
